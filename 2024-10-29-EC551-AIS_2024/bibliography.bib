  abstract = {This paper addresses the endogeneity of firms’ entry and exit decisions in estimating demand for differentiated products. Under standard conditions, the selection propensity score is insufficient to control selection bias, leading to the inconsistency of conventional methods of handling selection. We introduce a novel, straightforward two-step approach to estimate demand while accounting for endogenous product entry and exit. In the first step, our method estimates a nonparametric finite mixture model of product entry and exit that accommodates latent market types. Assuming a finite-dimensional support set for the latent variable does not introduce misspecification bias in the product entry model or the corresponding selection term used in demand estimation. In the second step, our method estimates the demand parameters while controlling for selection by incorporating product entry probabilities for each latent market type. We apply this approach to data from the airline industry, revealing that conventional methods to address selection bias underestimate demand price elasticities.},

Conditioning on the selection-propensity score therefore controls selection bias, a fact that underlies much of the literature on semi-parametric selection models. This note provides a general formulation of the conditional-independence properties that make it possible to control selection bias using the selection-propensity score.},

In the model, firms choose in which locations to pay the fixed costs of setting up production, taking into account potential complementarities among production locations. The firm’s location choice problem is combinatorial because the marginal value of an individual production location depends on its complete set of production sites. We develop a computational method to solve such problems and aggregate optimal decisions across heterogeneous firms. We use our calibrated model to study Brexit and the recent sanctions war with Russia. In both counterfactuals, changes in the location decisions of multinationals are driving real wage responses.},

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty y},

The primary methodology is to assume that demand can be described by a discrete-choice model and that prices are endogenously determined by price-setting firms. In contrast to some previous empirical work, the techniques explicitly allow for the possibility that prices are correlated with unobserved demand factors in the cross section of markets. The article proposes estimation by "inverting" the market-share equation to find the implied mean levels of utility for each good. This method allows for estimation by traditional instrumental variables techniques.},

  abstract = {Changes in product offerings are important for understanding changes in market outcomes in the automobile industry. In a global industry, national subsidies affect global market outcomes through firms’ product portfolio decisions. This paper proposes a new model to study product entry in a multi-market setting with product differentiation and heterogeneous consumer preferences within and across countries. Methodologically, the contribution of this paper is to provide a method to estimate and solve entry games with multiple asymmetric firms, each making multiple discrete choices. Using data on global passenger vehicle sales, prices, and product characteristics, I estimate large overhead product line costs, which imply that firms have strong incentives to offer the same product in different markets to achieve sufficient scale. I quantify the effects of discriminatory production and consumption subsidies favoring US brands in the United States. I find that global product portfolio changes in response to these policies cause profit shifting towards US brands worldwide and that changes in consumer surplus vary greatly across markets due to heterogeneity in preferences.},

Observed product range variation across countries exceeds the optimal firm-level response to differences in consumer preferences and retail environments. Counterfactual analysis reveals that increased product range standardization would reduce firm costs and increase profits. These findings are consistent with theory models of local agency, where decentralized decision making can be the constrained optimal organizational form despite the resulting lack of coordination across divisions. My analysis suggests that organizational structure affects product market outcomes and firm performance. (JEL D23, F23, L21, L25, L65)},
